### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Evotushon**, but you can call me **Evo**.

I'm an italian student who wants to get a job in Computer Science World.

I am **really meticolous** about not sharing any personal information than the ones I allow to share online

# Languages List (and why)
### Languages I program in ordered by how much I know them
  1. Python (with libraries too!) (beginner-friendly, and you can do pretty much everything with it)
  2. C# (basics) (Compiled languages are always good to have in your pocket)
### Languages I wanna learn:
  1. HTML, CSS (static web pages)
  2. JS/TS (Dynamic Web Pages, TS because as I said compiled languages are always good to have in your pocket + it's **really** a good language to use in basically every JS project)
  3. SQL and dialects
  4. Go (it's easy, good for backend, fast and is very flexible)
  5. C/C++ (~~I like suffering~~ Games ~~oh wait C#~~ I meant fast desktop apps and also ~~suffering because of pointers~~ the **mothers** of all languages)
  6. Lua (embedding is funny)
  7. Scala (I do like money, also similar to JS I guess)
  8. Rust (Basically a CC/C++++ (C+C/C++\*2? C*2/C**?)
  9. Java (
  ```java
  public class HelloWorld {public static void main(String []args) {System.out.println("Hello World");}}
  ```
  am I right? Ah right I didn't learn it in the first place because of how much things you need to put for a simple `Hello World` program; the fact that it is a byte code is good tho)
  8. Kotlin (Java but simpler am I right?)
